1. Bias-Variance Tradeoff
Bias refers to the error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the model, leading to underfitting.
Variance refers to the error due to excessive sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set, leading to overfitting.
The tradeoff is about finding a balance where the model generalizes well on unseen data. A high-bias model is too simple and underfits, while a high-variance model memorizes training data and fails on test data.
2. Cross-Validation
Cross-validation is a technique to evaluate a model's performance by splitting data into multiple folds.
k-fold cross-validation: The data is split into k subsets; the model trains on k-1 subsets and tests on the remaining one.
Importance: It ensures that every data point gets a chance to be in the training and test sets, leading to a more reliable performance estimate.
3. Handling Categorical Variables
Label Encoding: Assigns numerical values to categories (useful for tree-based models).
One-Hot Encoding: Converts categorical values into binary columns (preferred for linear models).
Target Encoding: Replaces categories with their mean target value (used in high-cardinality cases).
Embedding Layers: Used in deep learning for categorical representation.
4. Bagging vs. Boosting
Bagging: Reduces variance by training multiple models independently and averaging predictions (e.g., Random Forest).
Boosting: Reduces bias by training models sequentially, where each model corrects the errors of the previous one (e.g., XGBoost, AdaBoost).
5. Random Forest Algorithm
Ensemble of decision trees trained on random subsets of data with feature randomness.
Uses bagging to improve generalization.
Majority vote (classification) or averaging (regression) is used for prediction.
Handles missing values and is robust to overfitting.
6. Gradient Descent and Its Variants
Gradient Descent: Optimizes a function by iteratively adjusting parameters in the negative gradient direction.
Variants:
Batch GD: Uses all data per update (slow but stable).
Stochastic GD (SGD): Uses a single data point per update (fast but noisy).
Mini-batch GD: Uses a small batch per update (balance between stability and speed).
Momentum, Adam, RMSprop: Adaptive optimizers that improve convergence.
7. L1 vs. L2 Regularization
L1 (Lasso): Shrinks some weights to zero, useful for feature selection.
L2 (Ridge): Shrinks all weights but does not zero them out, reducing model complexity.
Elastic Net: Combines L1 and L2 for balanced regularization.
8. Feature Selection Methods
Filter Methods: Use statistical tests (e.g., correlation, chi-square).
Wrapper Methods: Train models with different feature subsets (e.g., RFE).
Embedded Methods: Feature selection occurs during model training (e.g., Lasso, tree-based models).
9. PCA vs. t-SNE
PCA: Reduces dimensionality by preserving variance (useful for linear structures).
t-SNE: Focuses on local structure, useful for visualizing high-dimensional clusters.
10. Hyperparameter Tuning
Grid Search: Exhaustive search over parameter combinations.
Random Search: Random sampling of hyperparameters.
Bayesian Optimization: Uses past results to model hyperparameter space efficiently.
AutoML: Automates hyperparameter tuning.
11. XGBoost and Its Improvements
Gradient Boosting with optimizations:
Regularization to prevent overfitting.
Histogram-based binning for speed.

12. Distance Metrics in Clustering
Euclidean: Straight-line distance (best for continuous data).
Manhattan: Sum of absolute differences (useful for grid-like structures).
Cosine Similarity: Measures angle similarity (useful for text and high-dimensional data).
Mahalanobis: Accounts for correlations between variables.
13. SVM and Kernel Trick
SVM finds the optimal hyperplane for classification.
Kernel Trick transforms non-linearly separable data into higher dimensions (e.g., RBF kernel).
14. Fixing Overfitting
Increase training data.
Use dropout (for deep learning).
Add L1/L2 regularization.
Prune trees (for tree-based models).
Use simpler models.
15. Ensemble Methods: Stacking vs. Blending vs. Bagging vs. Boosting
Bagging: Parallel training (Random Forest).
Boosting: Sequential training (XGBoost).
Stacking: Meta-learner combines multiple models.
Blending: Similar to stacking but uses validation set.
16. Bayesian Optimization
A probabilistic approach to find the best hyperparameters efficiently using prior knowledge.
17. Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm
Used for unsupervised clustering (e.g., GMM).
Iterates between expectation (E-step) and maximization (M-step).
18. Handling Imbalanced Data
Resampling: Oversampling minority class, undersampling majority.
Weighted Loss: Adjusting class weights in loss functions.
SMOTE: Synthesizing new samples for minority class.
19. Probabilistic vs. Non-Probabilistic Models
Probabilistic: Outputs probabilities (Naïve Bayes).
Non-Probabilistic: Directly classifies without probabilities (SVM).
20. Online vs. Batch Learning
Online: Model updates with incoming data (real-time applications).
Batch: Trained on entire dataset (stable but slow).
21. Handling Severe Class Imbalance

23. 95% Accuracy But Poor Performance
Class imbalance.
Wrong metric (use F1-score or Precision-Recall).
Poor generalization.
24. Handling Duplicates
If they provide useful information, keep them.
If redundant, remove them.
25. Optimizing Grid Search
Use Random Search or Bayesian Optimization.
Use early stopping.
26. Random Forest vs. Linear Regression
